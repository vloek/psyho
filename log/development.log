Москва) для последующего распространения в интересах заказчика.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Цель создания программы &ndash; предоставление возможности накопления и распространения обучающих программ и сопутствующего контента, сокращение времени распространения новых обучающих программ и материалов.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Федеральное агентство по делам Содружества Независимых Государств, соотечественников, проживающих за рубежом, и по международному гуманитарному сотрудничеству (Россотрудничество) было создано в сентябре 2008 года в соответствии с Указом Президента Российской Федерации от 6 сентября 2008 года No 1315.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>В своей деятельности Агентство подведомственно Министерств у иностранных дел Российской Федерации и руководствуется Конституцией Российской Федерации, федеральными конституционными законами, федеральными законами, нормативными правовыми актами Президента и Правительства Российской Федерации, международными договорами, нормативными правовыми актами МИД России.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Россотрудничество представлено в 77 странах 59 российскими центрами науки и культуры, 8 их филиалами (4 из которых в Индии) и 18 представителями федерального органа в составе дипломатических миссий Российской Федерации. Географически Россотрудничество охватывает территорию от Соединенных Штатов Америки до Японии и от Финляндии до Аргентины.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>В ближайшем будущем, наряду с открытием новых представительств и культурных центров, планируется активнее использовать так называемый &laquo;региональный принцип работы&raquo;, когда крупный культурный центр будет распространять свою деятельность не только на страну пребывания, но и на близлежащие страны, где нет российских культурных центров. В других регионах планеты деятельность Агентства также будет носить сетевой характер.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Приоритетным направлением деятельности Россотрудничества являются государства-участники Содружества Независимых Государств. Разработан перспективный план открытия российских центров науки и культуры и представительств Агентства до 2020 года.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Агентство обладает реально действующей системой поддержки русского языка за рубежом. Ведется активная работа по продвижению российских образовательных услуг и расширению сотрудничества между образовательными учреждениями стран партнеров. У деляется большое внимание работе с выпускниками российских (советских) вузов. Тысячи людей, и особенно молодежи, обучаются сегодня на курсах русского языка при загранучреждениях Россотрудничества во многих странах мира. В представительствах проводятся экзаменационные тесты, по результатам которых можно получить государственный сертификат, подтверждающий уровень владения русским языком. Заботясь о распространении русского языка, Агентство создает условия для его практического применения, а также получения образования на русском языке. Представительства Россотрудничества способствуют набору иностранных студентов в российские вузы и поддерживают связи с их выпускниками, которых по всему миру насчитывается более 500 тысяч.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Стратегическим инструментом реализации политики в области русского языка стала Федеральная целевая программа &laquo;Русский язык&raquo; на 2011-2015 годы, заказчиками которой выступили Министерство образования и науки Российской Федерации и Россотрудничество. Данная Программа утверждена Постановлением Правительства России от 20 июня 2011 г. N 492 и призвана стать одним из краеугольных камней формирования положительного образа страны за рубежом и поддержки российской культуры и русского языка.</p>\r\n", "menu_id"=>"2", "position"=>"", "status"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Update Page", "locale"=>"ru", "id"=>"3-o-proekte"}
